## About the Internship

**Duration**: 4 months  
**Focus**: Evaluating whether AlphaFold3 has overcome MSA dependence and comparing its performance with MSA-free models (ESMFold, OmegaFold).

**Key Findings**:
- AlphaFold3 has not eliminated MSA dependence, particularly for multi-chain assemblies
- Systematic overconfidence in predictions for intrinsically disordered proteins
- ESMFold emerges as a robust alternative for orphan proteins and high-throughput screening
